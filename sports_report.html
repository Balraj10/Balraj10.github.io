      <h3>Adding To An Ever-Growing Legacy</h3>
      <p>Kobe Bryant added another accomplishment to his prominent resume: The Oscar. After an illustrous NBA career, spanning two decades, Kobe Bryant continues to find success, but this time it was of the court. Kobe Bryant took home an Academy Award in
        the animated short film category on Sunday for his work 'Dear Basketball', which he made as the executive producer. 'Dear Basketball' journeys through Kobe Bryant's basketball career, starting with his dream to play in the NBA as a child and venturing
        into his stardom with the Los Angeles Lakers. 'Dear Basketball' is based on the poem Kobe Bryant had written in 2015 for the Players' Tribune.</p><br>

        <h3>From An Expansion Team To Title Contenders</h3>
        <p>The expectations were low for this team, made up of a group of ragtag players that teams didn't want. They were expected to be in rebuild for the forseeable future and yet, they are the second best team in the NHL so far this season.With players
          such as Marchessault, Peron, Sbisa, and Neal being the key players for this team. When the trade deadline rolled by, the Knights were aggressive, trying to land Karlsson right up until the deadline before finalizing other deals. They brought
          in Reaves in a three team trade for almost nothing and made their biggest move when they acquired Tatar for three picks.The Knights have only been improving and considering the success they are enjoying now as well as the depth of their team,
          the Knights have a legitimate chance at winning the Stanely Cup this summer.</p><br>

        <h3>O Captain, My Captain, You Shall Be Missed</h3>
        <p>Fiorentina soccer captain Davide Astori was discovered dead of cardiac arrest by natural causes on Sunday, just hours before an Italian legue match. The defender was discovered by club staff when he failed to arrive for breakfast at the hotel.
          In Florence, fans attached scarves, flowers, and messages to the gates of the team's stadium, while many other stadiums also put up banners to pay tribute to him. Many of his past and present teammates reached out and wrote touching tributes
          on their social media accounts to describe what kind of person Astori was and they found no better word than a comforting friend.</p><br>

        <h3>Overcoming The Odds</h3>
        <p>When Central Florida linebacker Shaquem Griffin came to the scouting combine, he knew he would face skepticism despite his eye-catching stats. All of Griffin's doubters gave only one reason as to why he would not make the NFL: he had only one
          hand. Griffin wasted no time in amazing everyone on Saturday by completing 20 reps in the 225-pound bench press with a prosthetic device clamped to the weight bar. Griffin also ran a 4.38-second 40-yard dash on Sunday, becoming the first defensive
          player at the NFL combine to weigh atleast 225 lbs and run a sub 4.4-second 40-yard dash since 2000. Griffin has been dominating the NFL combine and many NFL players are coming out and showing their support as well as many NFL teams are now
          interested in potentially drafting him.</p><br>
