    <h3>From An Expansion Team To Title Contenders</h3>
    	<p>The expectations were low for this team, made up of a group of ragtag players that teams didn't want. They were expected to be in rebuild for the forseeable future and yet, they are the second best team in the NHL so far this season.With players such as Marchessault, Peron, Sbisa, and Neal being the key players for this team. When the trade deadline rolled by, the Knights were aggressive, trying to land Karlsson right up until the deadline before finalizing other deals. They brought in Reaves in a three team trade for almost nothing and made their biggest move when they acquired Tatar for three picks.The Knights have only been improving and considering the success they are enjoying now as well as the depth of their team, the Knights have a legitimate chance at winning the Stanely Cup this summer.</p>
