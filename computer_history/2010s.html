      Siri is Announced
    </h2>
    <p>
      Siri is introduced as a built-in feature with the Apple iPhone 4S smartphone in October. A voice-activated personal assistant, Siri could “understand” natural language requests and also adjust the information it retrieved from the web by learning user
      tendencies and preferences. Siri could perform a wide number of functions – from recommending local restaurants (using the web and the iPhone’s built-in GPS navigation system), providing walking or driving directions, giving weather forecasts, showing
      current sports scores, and even answering seemingly meaningless questions like, “Who is your favorite NCAA college football team?” Although the program’s “voice” was female by default, it could be changed to a man’s voice.

      Facebook Acquires Instagram
    </h2>
    <p>
      Instagram, an image-sharing and social networking application, is purchased by Facebook for nearly $1 billion. It was initially launched in October 2010 by founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger and became an instant hit, with over 100 million active
      users by early 2013. Photos and videos (with 15 second maximum length) could be shared among users, who could then annotate these images with specific hash tags to enable them to be easily shared among other social media platforms such as Twitter
      and Facebook. Instagram also allowed users to manipulate their photos with a variety of digital filters such as “Slumber,” “Kelvin,” “1977,” “Sierra,” and “Inkwell.”

      The Stable Release of Microsoft Office 365 is Unveiled
    </h2>
    <p>
      An updated Microsoft Office 365 is announced. It was a subscription-based software product. Microsoft’s Word, Excel, OneNote, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access, and Publisher were all available in packages for a monthly or annual subscription. Also included
      with a subscription was 1 TB of cloud storage on Microsoft’s One Drive (formerly Skydrive). Home, personal, university, business, and enterprise subscription plans were made available for a wide range of users. Microsoft’s change to a subscription
      model was not unique: Apple, Adobe, IBM and many other large software and technology companies adopted this model as well.

    <h2>
      HTML 5 is Announced
    </h2>
    <p>
      HTML 5 is announced as the successor to HTML 4, which had become the standard for web markup languages in 1997. Markup languages describe how web pages will look and function. Work on HTML 5 had begun in 2004 under the auspices of the Web Hypertext Application
      Technology Working Group. It was simplified compared to its predecessors and was intended to be human-readable. HLTML 5 also offered a number of improvements for multimedia, such as simplifying the embedding of content such as streaming video and
      games into web pages.

    <h2>
      Apple Watch
    </h2>
    <p>
      Building a computer into the watch form factor has been attempted many times but the release of the Apple Watch leads to a new level of excitement. Incorporating a version of Apple's iOS operating system, as well as sensors for environmental and health
      monitoring, the Apple Watch was designed to be incorporated into the Apple environment with compatibility with iPhones and Mac Books. Almost a million units were ordered on the day of release. The Watch was received with great enthusiasm, but critics
      took issue with the somewhat limited battery life and high price.
