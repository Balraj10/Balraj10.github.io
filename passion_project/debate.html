    <p>The physics aspect of shooting a free throw involves distance and deviation. Distance is determined by two factors: launch angle and launch speed. Players have a choice between shooting for a larger target by using more arc or going for a shooter’s touch and shooting with their ideal arc for their height. Players should experiment and find which works best for them because this can vary from player to player.</p>

    <h1>James Harden</h1>
    </center>
    <p>James Harden is 6’ 5” and is shooting with a 49.6 degree launch angle, which is pretty much spot-on for his height to achieve the slowest moving ball at the rim. Hardin definitely has a ‘shooter’s touch’ going for him because he is releasing with the optimum angle for the slowest moving ball as it nears the rim.</p>
    <center>
    <h1>Stephen Curry</h1>
    </center>
    <p>However, Stephen Curry does not. Curry releases with a higher launch angle than average. According to the data from the NBA’s SportVU motion tracking, Curry is shooting with a 58.1 degree launch angle. Curry is opting for a larger target rather than a slow-moving ball as it nears the rim. The higher the launch angle the larger the target area of the rim. All players have different consistency in release angles and velocities.  Some might need more space for error in velocity, and thus need a higher throwing angle, while others might aim lower because their velocity control is much stronger.</p>
